# CarCam

This app aims to become a cheap alternative to an average driver's dashcam needs. 
Since the app was written using the React Native framework, it works on both Android
and iOS operating systems. It is capable of recording videos, saving them using asynchronous
storage within the app (with native playback features), and detecting if the user was in an accident.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the Expo Client app on your Android or iOS device.
2. Open the following link and the app will build on your device locally.
